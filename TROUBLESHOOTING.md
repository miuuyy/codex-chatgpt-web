# Troubleshooting

This guide covers the failures reported most often in GitHub issues. Start here before reinstalling,
editing Codex configuration, or opening a new issue.

## The first five minutes

1. Install the [latest release](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest). Quit
   **Codex Web GPT** before running the installer again; updating preserves its private ChatGPT
   profile and launcher configuration.
2. In the launcher, confirm that ChatGPT sign-in, the browser smoke test, and **Install models** (or
   **Repair Codex setup**) are green.
3. Fully quit Codex, including its background process, and reopen it. Signing out, closing only the
   window, or starting another task does not reload the model catalog. Keep the launcher open.
4. Select a **ChatGPT Web — …** model from Codex's model picker.
5. Run **Settings → Run doctor**. If the problem remains, reproduce it once and immediately use
   **Activity → Export safe log**.

Do not repeatedly press setup actions after they report success. The exact error and a fresh safe
log are more useful than another reinstall.

## Models do not appear, or setup remains on step 3

**Install models** updates the Codex route, but a running Codex process keeps its old model catalog.
Fully quit every Codex Desktop window and Codex CLI process, then reopen Codex while the launcher is
still running. The launcher should move from **Restart Codex** to a verified catalog state.

If the models still do not appear:

- run **Repair Codex setup** once;
- check **Settings → Run doctor**;
- make sure another Codex wrapper is not replacing the route; and
- export a safe log after the failed catalog check.

A green step 3 followed by a browser-turn error means installation succeeded. Repeating step 3 will
not repair an unrelated ChatGPT browser or model-turn failure.

## `openai_base_url changed after setup` or a model is "not supported"

The launcher deliberately refuses to overwrite a route changed by another tool. Only one program
can own Codex's `openai_base_url` at a time. Wrappers and routers such as OpenCodex, Headroom,
OmniRoute, Codex++, CC Switch, or a manually configured provider may replace the Codex Web GPT route
for the whole installation or only for the process they launch.

Choose one route owner:

- To use Codex Web GPT, disable the other wrapper's provider/proxy mode, run **Repair Codex setup**,
  fully restart Codex, and start Codex directly rather than through the wrapper command.
- A tool may remain enabled only as an MCP integration if it does not replace `openai_base_url`.
- To switch away cleanly, use **Settings → Remove Codex integration** first. This restores the exact
  route that existed before Codex Web GPT was installed.

Do not hand-edit the launcher's route journal. It exists so setup and removal can fail closed instead
of silently destroying another provider's configuration. First-class external-router composition is
tracked in [#205](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/issues/205), but is not supported today.

## ChatGPT sign-in does not complete

The launcher must own the ChatGPT session used for model turns. Signing in to an unrelated browser
window does not automatically transfer that session.

- Complete ordinary sign-in inside the launcher-owned flow and wait until a Temporary Chat composer
  is visible.
- Do not navigate or close the launcher browser while authentication or session verification is
  running.
- If the account offers **Try another way**, an alternate authentication method can avoid a
  platform-passkey limitation.
- Passkey-only macOS accounts have a known open issue: [#209](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/issues/209).
  If no alternate method exists, follow that issue rather than repeatedly deleting the browser
  profile; there is no safe generic workaround to claim yet.

If an ordinary login still fails, export a safe log immediately after one attempt. Include the OS,
launcher version, account tier, sign-in provider, and whether the Temporary Chat composer ever
appeared. Never upload cookies, browser storage, authentication headers, or raw profile files.

## The browser smoke test fails

The smoke test and real turns use the same current ChatGPT controls. Errors mentioning the effort
control, composer, send button, Temporary Chat, personalization, or an operational viewport usually
mean that the ChatGPT UI did not expose a structure the bridge can safely prove.

1. Update to the latest release.
2. Confirm that a normal Temporary Chat can be opened in the launcher and that the account is not
   showing a login, onboarding, capacity, or rate-limit dialog.
3. Run the smoke test one more time with the launcher visible.
4. If the same structural error remains, do not keep retrying. Export a safe log and open a focused
   bug report; ChatGPT UI drift must be fixed against the observed DOM, not guessed around.

Free and Go accounts normally expose Luna and Think without the paid-account effort selector. A
missing paid selector on those accounts is not itself a sign-in failure.

## Full harness or MCP verification fails

Browser-only mode needs no connector. Full harness mode requires all of the following:

- a newly created connector named exactly **Codex Native2**;
- **Developer Mode** enabled in ChatGPT;
- the exact Tunnel selected with **Authentication: None**;
- the connector and Tunnel on the same OpenAI account as the ChatGPT workspace;
- **Allow all actions** under the connector's permissions; and
- **Connect harness** completed before **Verify runtime**.

Do not rename or refresh an old **Codex Native** connector. ChatGPT caches the public MCP contract by
connector identity, so create **Codex Native2** as a new connector.

If tool calls work until native Codex quota is exhausted and then edits are denied by **Automatic
approval review**, disable that optional Codex review setting and restart Codex. The outer Codex
sandbox and explicit approvals still apply; this only prevents an unavailable native model from
being inserted as an extra reviewer after the Web tool call already completed.

## `Reconnecting`, `stream disconnected`, or `ChatGPT failed`

These are result boundaries, not one diagnosis. The bridge uses them when it cannot prove a complete
ChatGPT turn. Common causes include an account-side rate limit, ChatGPT's own "Something went wrong"
state, a changed UI control, a closed browser surface, a conflicting route, or a tool that exceeded
its bounded MCP deadline.

- Read the final detailed error after the reconnect attempts; do not report only the word
  `Reconnecting`.
- Retry once in a fresh Codex task. State whether the fresh task works and whether the failure is
  consistent.
- Run **Settings → Run doctor** and export a safe log immediately after the failure.
- Include the exact model, Browser-only or Full harness mode, whether tools ran, and whether the
  ChatGPT page showed a final answer.

Do not assume that a generic 502 means the Tunnel is broken. Since v4.0.7, a native tool that
outlives its turn binding is reported explicitly as `codex_tool_timeout` and retired rather than
being presented as an ambiguous proxy success.

## ChatGPT says the account is temporarily limited

The bridge permits at most five simultaneous browser tabs as an account-safety ceiling. Five is not
a recommended concurrency setting, and ChatGPT does not expose a stable numeric quota or cooldown.
Some accounts have reached a limit with only two turns started close together.

After the first account-side limit response, stop retrying and let the cooldown clear. For a
conservative starting point, set one spawned agent thread at a time in the existing `[agents]`
section of `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents]
max_concurrent_threads_per_session = 1
```

If the table already exists, add or change only the key; do not create a second `[agents]` table.
Bigger Context can make one turn larger and longer, but does not increase safe account concurrency.

## Images from earlier turns are attached again

Codex includes prior task images in the canonical conversation context. The bridge follows that
context and keeps only the newest ten complete images, so seeing an earlier image again in the same
task is expected. Start a new Codex task when the new request must not carry earlier image context.

Open an issue if the launcher reports that ChatGPT did not accept all attachments, or if images from
a different Codex task appear. Include a fresh safe log with the failing trace and attachment stage.
Do not replace inline images with arbitrary local paths: browser-only and compaction turns
intentionally do not receive unrestricted filesystem access.

## Image generation stops before an image appears

Image generation is not currently a supported turn type. ChatGPT uses a separate generation backend
and lifecycle that the text-response bridge cannot reliably prove complete or retrieve through its
current contract. This is tracked as a possible future feature, not as a text-streaming timeout.

## Update, repair, and remove

To update, quit **Codex Web GPT** and run the same installer command from the README. The installer
replaces the application and runtime while preserving the launcher configuration and private
ChatGPT profile.

To repair a valid installation, use **Repair Codex setup** once and fully restart Codex. Avoid
deleting configuration until **Run doctor** and a safe log identify which layer failed.

To remove the integration safely:

1. Open **Settings → Remove Codex integration** and wait for it to restore the previous Codex route.
2. Fully restart Codex.
3. Quit the launcher and uninstall the application normally for the platform.
4. If Full harness was configured and is no longer wanted, separately delete **Codex Native2**, its
   Tunnel, and the API key created for that Tunnel from the corresponding account settings.

Deleting the application before step 1 can leave Codex pointed at a local route that no longer
exists.

## Open a useful bug report

Use the repository's bug-report form and attach the privacy-safe export from **Activity → Export
safe log**. A useful report contains:

- launcher version and installation method;
- Codex Desktop and/or CLI version;
- OS and architecture;
- ChatGPT account tier;
- Browser-only or Full harness mode and the exact selected model;
- exact reproduction steps and complete final error;
- whether it reproduces in a fresh Codex task; and
- a safe log captured immediately after that reproduction.

Screenshots are welcome, but a screenshot without the exact error and fresh log is usually not
enough to distinguish setup, routing, browser DOM, account, and MCP failures.

Before uploading anything, read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Never publish raw launcher logs, cookies,
browser storage, API keys, Tunnel IDs, full Codex prompts, tool output containing private data, or
absolute private paths.
